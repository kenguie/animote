# Animote

### Description

We wanted to create a site that would help people either let off some steam by being a psychological adjunct to their current emotion or explore an entirely different emotion.

## How it works 

Ruby on Rails / Sass / Javascript / Html5 

## Challenges I ran into 

Working with a group on a very complex idea.  Randomization of music / images / colors in conjunction with media and media players of all kinds were a challenge overcome.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of 

Our intended purpose was achieved and we believe our site does elicit an emotional response, whichever one you choose.
